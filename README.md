Abstract: Through building a logistic regression model to predict heart disease using demographics, behavioural and medical condition features, we’ve learned that holding other features constant, people who had previous had a stroke is almost 2 (1.84) times higher than for people who hadn’t. The possibility of getting diagnosed with heart disease for males is 62% higher than for females. Increases in age, number of cigarettes smoked per day and systolic blood pressure also increase the possibility of getting diagnosed with heart disease.
